Introductory Paper
	Even though this internship is being held online this summer, my goals I would like to accomplish are still the same. The first goal of mine is to learn a new coding language and implement it into a real-world application. Many different jobs require different coding languages, so I would like to learn many of them in order to increase my chances of successfully landing a career. By achieving this goal, I can worry less about what a job requires and focus more about landing a job that fits my own requirements of a career that I want to pursue. I am already starting to work on this goal, as I will be learning JavaScript to help build a front-end website.
	Another goal of mine is receive professional criticism from the work that I create. The best way to learn more about careers is to get reviewed by the professionals working in the fields. By receiving constructive feedback, it will strengthen my knowledge about the web development sub-field I currently am in. Additionally, it will build up my ability to write and handle code in a more professional fashion that gets the job done as well as being efficient for both the client and developer.
	My last goal is to make new connections with others. Whether it be as good friends or for landing the dream job, I want to meet new people to help me grow positively as an individual. Being online and an introvert, this might prove to be a more difficult goal to accomplish. However, I will not let that hinder me and I will resort to digital chatting to make up for this.
	Lastly, one personal thing I am looking forward to is the events where I get a chance to listen to professionals discussing topics about their work. I enjoy learning a little knowledge from a variety of areas so this will be a valuable experience for me. Whether it be learning new facts or lessons of life, I will use the information said by these professionals to my advantage in life.
